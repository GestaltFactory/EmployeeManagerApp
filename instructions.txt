For login
	employee => test/Test123!
 	Admin => karl/Karl123!
when no admin exist or list of emp is empty otherwise it is disabled. 
This user should no be used to do anything other than creating an admin if one is required.
 	SuperUser => yan/123

I used a relative path for the headshot of the emp
it should work on your side too.

You can only access the creation and edit pages if you are an admin,
a emp only has access to the display view form once he is log in

You can't delete anything, you archive instead by moving the deleted line to another file before deleting
it from the first.

Everything worked when i tested it on my side so it should on yours too.

The emp and task in the list are garbage for testing. I kept them there anyway to have something to test.
Some pictures are there also for the same reason and they are bind to their emp so it might crash if they are moved.
